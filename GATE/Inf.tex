\item The frequency of occurrence of 8 symbols (a-h) is shown in the table below. A
symbol is chosen and it is determined by asking a series of “yes/no” questions which
are assumed to be truthfully answered. The average number of questions when asked
in the most efficient sequence, to determine the chosen symbol, is \\

\item The transition diagram of a discrete memoryless channel with three input symbols
and three output symbols is shown in the figure. The transition probabilities are as
marked.\\
The parameter $\alpha$ lies in the interval $\sbrak{0.25,1}$. The value of $\alpha$ for which the capacity of this channel is maximized, is
